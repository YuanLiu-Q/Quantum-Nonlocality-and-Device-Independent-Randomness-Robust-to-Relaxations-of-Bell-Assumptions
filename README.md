This repository contains MATLAB code and accompanying notes for the manuscript  
**“Quantum Nonlocality and Device-Independent Randomness Robust to Relaxations of Bell Assumptions”**.

It is organised into three main components:

1. **Note: “Facet inequality of the epsilon-Parameter dependent polytope”**  
   In this note we provide the full list of vertices that saturate the classical bound of the facet inequality for the epsilon–parameter-dependent polytope. These explicit vertex lists are omitted from the manuscript due to space constraints but are included here for completeness.

2. **Folder: `Detection Efficiency`**  
   This folder contains a numerical analysis showing that the two-qubit strategy described in the manuscript tolerates a detection efficiency of 2/3, matching the well-known Eberhard correlation detection efficiency threshold.  
   Concretely, we compute the local fraction of:
   - the quantum behaviour generated by the qubit strategy, and  
   - the Eberhard correlation,  
   when non-detected events are included with detection efficiency eta close to 2/3.  
   In both cases, the local fraction is strictly less than 1, demonstrating that the resulting correlations remain nonlocal at this detection efficiency.

3. **File: `pg_two_way_leakage.m`**  
   This script computes the quantum adversary Eve’s guessing probability for Alice’s first measurement outcome, where both Alice’s and Bob’s input infomration is partially leaked, and conditioned on an observed CHSH value on the Alice–Bob system.  


**Dependencies**: [CVX] and [MOSEK] for formulating and solving the semidefinite programs and linear programs; [Moment] for constructing moment and localizing matrices in Bell scenarios.
